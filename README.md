### TenPatch ###

Version 5.0.0

This project is an alternative to libGDX's 9patch implementation. It has the following features:

* Multiple stretch regions as seen with Android's implementation.
* An option for tiling stretch regions.
* Tiling offsets to achieve the appearance of a moving background.
* Tintable.
* Gradients.
* Animated images.
* Can be shrunk to size 0 without the artificats as seen in libGDX's 9patch.
* Loading via skin JSON.
* An editor via [Skin Composer](https://github.com/raeleus/skin-composer).

### How to Use ###

Add the following to your root build.gradle:

```groovy
allprojects {
    ...
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Add the dependency to the core project:

```groovy
project(":core") {
    apply plugin: "java"


    dependencies {
        ...
        compile 'com.github.raeleus.TenPatch:tenpatch:5.0.0'
    }
}
```

For HTML5/GWT support, add the dependency to the html project:

```groovy
project(":html") {
    apply plugin: "gwt"
    apply plugin: "war"


    dependencies {
        ...
        compile 'com.github.raeleus.TenPatch:tenpatch:5.0.0:sources'
    }
}
```

And add the following line to the GdxDefinition.gwt.xml file in the HTML project:
```xml
<inherits name="com.ray3k.tenpatch.tenpatch"/>
```
